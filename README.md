ok so what i want to get to is: black background, and new players log in as a random (or chosen) color circle and their username on a given screen. you can hover over other circles to see their username.

step 1: paint the circles at random per player

found where player is init'd, now to find where they're drawn

decided to kill mods. having mods implies that it's friendly to modification, which is not an expectation i plan to live up to
